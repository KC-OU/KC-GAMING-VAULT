## Plot and Story
On the morning of October 23, 2077, a father stares at his reflection in a foggy mirror and remarks war never changes. His wife tells him to stop hogging the mirror. ![[Fallout4-V111-PreWar.webp|right|500]]
The player may play as the mother or father. The protagonist walks around their house and speaks to their Mr. Handy, [Codsworth](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Codsworth "Codsworth"). A [representative](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault-Tec_rep "Vault-Tec rep") from the [Vault-Tec Corporation](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault-Tec_Corporation "Vault-Tec Corporation") arrives and says because of the contributions of their family to the country, they have been chosen to be allowed in the local [Vault](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault "Vault"), [Vault 111](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_111 "Vault 111"). The protagonist decides to verify their information. After the representative leaves, Shaun cries and his parent spins a mobile over their crib to calm him down. Codsworth implores the family to see a TV broadcast, confirming that America is being nuked. Sirens begin blaring in Sanctuary Hills, causing all the residents to flee to the local Vault, but only those who are approved access are allowed past a security gate. 


![[FO4_Trailer_02.10.webp|left|500]]The protagonist descends into the Vault seconds before they are hit by the explosion. Inside, the new residents are welcomed by the [Vault 111 overseer](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_111_overseer "Vault 111 overseer"), given their [jumpsuits](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_jumpsuit_(Fallout_4) "Vault jumpsuit (Fallout 4)"), and a doctor implores them to enter a decontamination and depressurization chamber. After what appears to be a few moments inside the pod, the protagonist witnesses a [mysterious man](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Conrad_Kellogg "Conrad Kellogg") open their spouse's pod and try to take Shaun. The spouse refuses and so the man kills the spouse and steals the baby. The man then looks at the protagonist and calls them the "backup" before leaving.

After what seems to be more moments, the pod opens and mentions that they were actually inside a cryogenic chamber; the other residents asphyxiated to death in their pods. The protagonist mourns their spouse, takes their [wedding ring](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wedding_ring_(Fallout_4) "Wedding ring (Fallout 4)") and says they will seek vengeance. The protagonist makes their way outside the Vault which has become infested with [giant roaches](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Radroach_(Fallout_4) "Radroach (Fallout 4)"), realizing they are the Sole Survivor. Back on the surface, the Sole Survivor sees the ruins of Sanctuary Hills and discovers from Codsworth that 210 years have passed since that fateful morning.

After a sweep of the neighborhood, the Sole Survivor discovers no evidence of Shaun. ![[PiperBGS.webp|right|500]]They learn that survivors may be in [Concord](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Concord "Concord") so they head there and meet [Preston Garvey](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Preston_Garvey "Preston Garvey") of the    [Commonwealth Minutemen](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Commonwealth_Minutemen "Commonwealth Minutemen"). They are told [Diamond City](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Diamond_City "Diamond City") may be a good lead and at the front gates, they meet [Piper Wright](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Piper_Wright "Piper Wright"), a reporter who has been banned from the city because she wrote a speculatory article suggesting the [mayor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/McDonough "McDonough") could be a synth. Piper uses the Sole Survivor to get back into the city; inside, they meet [Nick Valentine](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nick_Valentine "Nick Valentine"), a friendly synth detective who has been allowed to live in the city. Nick encourages the Sole Survivor to investigate [Conrad Kellogg](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Conrad_Kellogg "Conrad Kellogg"), the suspect of Shaun's kidnapping.

![[FO4_Kidnapping_Shaun.webp|left|500]]They find a [cigar](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/San_Francisco_Sunlights "San Francisco Sunlights") in Kellogg's house which [Dogmeat](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Dogmeat "Dogmeat") tracks to [Fort Hagen](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fort_Hagen "Fort Hagen") where the Sole Survivor kills Kellogg. Upon leaving, a [Brotherhood of Steel](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Steel "Brotherhood of Steel") [airship](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Prydwen "The Prydwen") flies to the [Boston Airport](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Boston_Airport "Boston Airport") where the Sole Survivor can learn about the group and possibly join them; if done, the Sole Survivor can discover [Paladin Danse](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Danse "Danse") was secretly a synth all along who was unaware, and either let him go or execute him per [Arthur Maxson](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Arthur_Maxson "Arthur Maxson")'s orders. Kellogg was a cyborg and a device connected to his brain allows the Sole Survivor to dive into his memories with the assistance of [Doctor Amari](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Amari "Amari") at the [Memory Den](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Memory_Den "Memory Den"). Inside Kellogg's memories, the Sole Survivor witnesses moments of Kellogg's life, sees Shaun has grown up to be a young boy, and discovers the secret of how the Institute manages to lay low: teleportation.

![[Brian_Virgil.webp|right|500]]

Kellogg's memories and Amari's advice indicate that the Sole Survivor should locate an escaped Institute scientist, [Brian Virgil](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brian_Virgil "Brian Virgil"), who escaped to the [Glowing Sea](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Glowing_Sea "Glowing Sea") after intentionally transforming himself into a super mutant to escape the Institute. Virgil informs the Sole Survivor they need to collect a "courser chip" for the teleportation so they kill a courser, [Z2-47](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Z2-47 "Z2-47"). To use it, Virgil tells the Sole Survivor to find a synth liberation faction called [the Railroad](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Railroad "The Railroad"). Using the [Freedom Trail](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Freedom_Trail "Freedom Trail"), which is a red colored brick pathway in Boston's streets, the Sole Survivor finds them located under a [church](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Old_North_Church "Old North Church") led by a woman named [Desdemona](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Desdemona "Desdemona"). She implores the Sole Survivor to keep their location hidden, but is willing to let them join if they desire.



![[FO4_Shaun_and_Sole_Survivor.webp|left|500]]With the help of either the Minutemen, Brotherhood or the Railroad, the Sole Survivor builds a teleporter to enter [their facility](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Institute_(location) "The Institute (location)") where they discover Shaun, but not in the way they expected. The Sole Survivor quickly discovers there is something off about "[Shaun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Shaun_(synth) "Shaun (synth)")" during their conversation, especially when their child appears to be disturbed by the reunion and is deactivated like a synth. The real Shaun enters the room, who is actually an elderly man who has become the leader of the Institute, due to being removed from the cyro pod many decades ago and growing under the Institute's wing long before the Sole Survivor woke up.

Shaun allows his parent to wander around the facility in order to learn more about the Institute and get to know its employees. The Sole Survivor learns the Institute is an advanced technological site of innovation, capable of teleportation and making artificial humans and [gorillas](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gorilla "Gorilla"), but they are also incompetent when it comes to keeping their synths in check, making![[FO4_gorilla_synth.webp|right|500]] them require "[coursers](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Courser "Courser")" to go after escaped synths, and even dedicate an entire sub-organization called the [Synth Retention Bureau](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Synth_Retention_Bureau "Synth Retention Bureau"). Despite their inventions, they can not cure Shaun's cancer either. Before leaving, the Sole Survivor meets [Madison Li](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Madison_Li "Madison Li") who gives them the ability to teleport into the Institute. In the Sole Survivor's free time, they may also discover the [reason](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Liam_Binet "Liam Binet") why synths are able to escape the Institute in the first place.


After leaving the Institute, the player is encouraged to take a faction's side which will result in angering another faction due to their differing views on synths and inability to compromise, especially due to Shaun's rigid belief that synths are not sentient. As a result of Shaun's, Desdemona's and Maxson's differences of opinion, the three leaders instead demand the Sole Survivor to go on a murder spree and wipe out the other factions. However, if the player purchased the add-ons, the player can instead take a boat ride to [Far Harbor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Far_Harbor_(location) "Far Harbor (location)") and [the Island](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Island "The Island") or a subway ![train to [Nuka-World](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nuka-World_(location) "Nuka-World (location)"), before deciding on a faction. The former story involves the mysterious disappearance of a teenager named [Kasumi Nakano](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Kasumi_Nakano "Kasumi Nakano") and focuses on synths, while the latter story focuses on three gangs trying to dominate the abandoned theme park.  ![[FH_Kenji_Nakano_02.webp|500]]
